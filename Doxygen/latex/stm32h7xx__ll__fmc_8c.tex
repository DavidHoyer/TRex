FMC Low Layer HAL module driver. 

\begin{DoxyAuthor}{Author}
MCD Application Team \begin{DoxyVerb}     This file provides firmware functions to manage the following
     functionalities of the Flexible Memory Controller (FMC) peripheral memories:
      + Initialization/de-initialization functions
      + Peripheral Control functions
      + Peripheral State functions
\end{DoxyVerb}
 \begin{DoxyVerb}==============================================================================
                      ##### FMC peripheral features #####
==============================================================================
[..] The Flexible memory controller (FMC) includes following memory controllers:
     (+) The NOR/PSRAM memory controller
   (+) The NAND memory controller
     (+) The Synchronous DRAM (SDRAM) controller

[..] The FMC functional block makes the interface with synchronous and asynchronous static
     memories and SDRAM memories. Its main purposes are:
     (+) to translate AHB transactions into the appropriate external device protocol
     (+) to meet the access time requirements of the external memory devices

[..] All external memories share the addresses, data and control signals with the controller.
     Each external device is accessed by means of a unique Chip Select. The FMC performs
     only one access at a time to an external device.
     The main features of the FMC controller are the following:
      (+) Interface with static-memory mapped devices including:
         (++) Static random access memory (SRAM)
         (++) Read-only memory (ROM)
         (++) NOR Flash memory/OneNAND Flash memory
         (++) PSRAM (4 memory banks)
         (++) Two banks of NAND Flash memory with ECC hardware to check up to 8 Kbytes of
              data
      (+) Interface with synchronous DRAM (SDRAM) memories
      (+) Independent Chip Select control for each memory bank
      (+) Independent configuration for each memory bank\end{DoxyVerb}
