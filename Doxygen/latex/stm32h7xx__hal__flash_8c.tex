\begin{DoxyVerb} ==============================================================================
                       ##### FLASH peripheral features #####
 ==============================================================================

 [..] The Flash memory interface manages CPU AXI I-Code and D-Code accesses
      to the Flash memory. It implements the erase and program Flash memory operations
      and the read and write protection mechanisms.

 [..] The FLASH main features are:
     (+) Flash memory read operations
     (+) Flash memory program/erase operations
     (+) Read / write protections
     (+) Option bytes programming
     (+) Error code correction (ECC) : Data in flash are 266-bits word
         (10 bits added per flash word)

                       ##### How to use this driver #####
==============================================================================
   [..]
     This driver provides functions and macros to configure and program the FLASH
     memory of all STM32H7xx devices.

     (#) FLASH Memory IO Programming functions:
          (++) Lock and Unlock the FLASH interface using HAL_FLASH_Unlock() and
               HAL_FLASH_Lock() functions
          (++) Program functions: 256-bit word only
          (++) There Two modes of programming :
           (+++) Polling mode using HAL_FLASH_Program() function
           (+++) Interrupt mode using HAL_FLASH_Program_IT() function

     (#) Interrupts and flags management functions :
          (++) Handle FLASH interrupts by calling HAL_FLASH_IRQHandler()
          (++) Callback functions are called when the flash operations are finished :
               HAL_FLASH_EndOfOperationCallback() when everything is ok, otherwise
               HAL_FLASH_OperationErrorCallback()
          (++) Get error flag status by calling HAL_FLASH_GetError()

     (#) Option bytes management functions :
          (++) Lock and Unlock the option bytes using HAL_FLASH_OB_Unlock() and
               HAL_FLASH_OB_Lock() functions
          (++) Launch the reload of the option bytes using HAL_FLASH_OB_Launch() function.
               In this case, a reset is generated
   [..]
     In addition to these functions, this driver includes a set of macros allowing
     to handle the following operations:
      (+) Set the latency
      (+) Enable/Disable the FLASH interrupts
      (+) Monitor the FLASH flags status
    [..]
   (@) For any Flash memory program operation (erase or program), the CPU clock frequency
       (HCLK) must be at least 1MHz.
   (@) The contents of the Flash memory are not guaranteed if a device reset occurs during
       a Flash memory operation.
   (@) The application can simultaneously request a read and a write operation through each AXI
       interface.
       As the Flash memory is divided into two independent banks, the embedded Flash
       memory interface can drive different operations at the same time on each bank. For
       example a read, write or erase operation can be executed on bank 1 while another read,
       write or erase operation is executed on bank 2.\end{DoxyVerb}
