\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Delay\+Block Low Layer HAL module driver. 

\begin{DoxyAuthor}{Author}
MCD Application Team \begin{DoxyVerb}     This file provides firmware functions to manage the following 
     functionalities of the Delay Block peripheral:
      + input clock frequency range 25MHz to 208MHz
      + up to 12 oversampling phases
\end{DoxyVerb}

                     ##### DelayBlock peripheral features #####
==============================================================================        
  [..] The Delay block is used to generate an Output clock which is de-phased from the Input
        clock. The phase of the Output clock is programmed by FW. The Output clock is then used
        to clock the receive data in i.e. a SDMMC or QSPI interface.
       The delay is Voltage and Temperature dependent, which may require FW to do re-tuning
        and recenter the Output clock phase to the receive data.
  
  [..] The Delay Block features include the following:
       (+) Input clock frequency range 25MHz to 208MHz.
       (+) Up to 12 oversampling phases.
       
                         ##### How to use this driver #####
==============================================================================
  [..]
    This driver is a considered as a driver of service for external devices drivers
    that interfaces with the DELAY peripheral.
    The DelayBlock_Enable() function, enables the DelayBlock instance, configure the delay line length
    and configure the Output clock phase.
    The DelayBlock_Disable() function, disables the DelayBlock instance by setting DEN flag to 0.\end{DoxyVerb}
