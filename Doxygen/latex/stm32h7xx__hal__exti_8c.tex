                  ##### EXTI Peripheral features #####
==============================================================================
[..]
  (+) Each Exti line can be configured within this driver.

  (+) Exti line can be configured in 3 different modes
      (++) Interrupt (CORE1 or CORE2 in case of dual core line )
      (++) Event (CORE1 or CORE2 in case of dual core line )
      (++) a combination of the previous

  (+) Configurable Exti lines can be configured with 3 different triggers
      (++) Rising
      (++) Falling
      (++) Both of them

  (+) When set in interrupt mode, configurable Exti lines have two diffenrents
      interrupt pending registers which allow to distinguish which transition
      occurs:
      (++) Rising edge pending interrupt
      (++) Falling

  (+) Exti lines 0 to 15 are linked to gpio pin number 0 to 15. Gpio port can
      be selected through multiplexer.

  (+) PendClearSource used to set the D3 Smart Run Domain autoamtic pend clear source.
      It is applicable for line with wkaeup target is Any (CPU1 , CPU2 and D3 smart run domain).
      Value can be one of the following:
      (++)  EXTI_D3_PENDCLR_SRC_NONE : no pend clear source is selected :
            In this case corresponding bit of D2PMRx register is set to 0
              (+++) On a configurable Line : the D3 domain wakeup signal is
                    automatically cleared after after the Delay + Rising Edge detect
              (+++) On a direct Line : the D3 domain wakeup signal is
                    cleared after the direct event input signal is cleared

      (++)  EXTI_D3_PENDCLR_SRC_DMACH6 : no pend clear source is selected :
            In this case corresponding bit of D2PMRx register is set to 1
            and corresponding bits(2) of D3PCRxL/H is set to b00 :
              DMA ch6 event selected as D3 domain pendclear source

      (++)  EXTI_D3_PENDCLR_SRC_DMACH7 : no pend clear source is selected :
            In this case corresponding bit of D2PMRx register is set to 1
            and corresponding bits(2) of D3PCRxL/H is set to b01 :
              DMA ch7 event selected as D3 domain pendclear source

      (++)  EXTI_D3_PENDCLR_SRC_LPTIM4 : no pend clear source is selected :
            In this case corresponding bit of D2PMRx register is set to 1
            and corresponding bits(2) of D3PCRxL/H is set to b10 :
              LPTIM4 out selected as D3 domain pendclear source

      (++)  EXTI_D3_PENDCLR_SRC_LPTIM5 : no pend clear source is selected :
            In this case corresponding bit of D2PMRx register is set to 1
            and corresponding bits(2) of D3PCRxL/H is set to b11 :
              LPTIM5 out selected as D3 domain pendclear source


                   ##### How to use this driver #####
==============================================================================
[..]

  (#) Configure the EXTI line using HAL_EXTI_SetConfigLine().
      (++) Choose the interrupt line number by setting "Line" member from
           EXTI_ConfigTypeDef structure.
      (++) Configure the interrupt and/or event mode using "Mode" member from
           EXTI_ConfigTypeDef structure.
      (++) For configurable lines, configure rising and/or falling trigger
           "Trigger" member from EXTI_ConfigTypeDef structure.
      (++) For Exti lines linked to gpio, choose gpio port using "GPIOSel"
           member from GPIO_InitTypeDef structure.
      (++) For Exti lines with wkaeup target is Any (CPU1 , CPU2 and D3 smart run domain),
           choose gpio D3 PendClearSource using PendClearSource
           member from EXTI_PendClear_Source structure.

  (#) Get current Exti configuration of a dedicated line using
      HAL_EXTI_GetConfigLine().
      (++) Provide exiting handle as parameter.
      (++) Provide pointer on EXTI_ConfigTypeDef structure as second parameter.

  (#) Clear Exti configuration of a dedicated line using HAL_EXTI_GetConfigLine().
      (++) Provide exiting handle as parameter.

  (#) Register callback to treat Exti interrupts using HAL_EXTI_RegisterCallback().
      (++) Provide exiting handle as first parameter.
      (++) Provide which callback will be registered using one value from
           EXTI_CallbackIDTypeDef.
      (++) Provide callback function pointer.

  (#) Get interrupt pending bit using HAL_EXTI_GetPending().

  (#) Clear interrupt pending bit using HAL_EXTI_GetPending().

  (#) Generate software interrupt using HAL_EXTI_GenerateSWI().\end{DoxyVerb}
